Description
-----------
The official [FreeAgent](http://www.freeagent.com/) Ruby Client Library provides a simple Ruby interface for the [FreeAgent API 2.0](https://dev.freeagent.com/)

So what does this library have? Well the library wraps the API into a lovely little package providing rails-esque querying which makes it trivial to talk to FreeAgent.

Want all your draft invoices? Simple:
    `Invoice.draft`
 
Want to find all your contacts with open invoices?
    `Contact.open_clients` 

Want to find your recurring expenses? Come on youâ€™re not even making this hard anymore:
    `Expense.recurring`
 
Important Notes
---------------
Please note the client is still a work in progress and is considered alpha.

Consequently, at this time it is advisable not to use this library in your development.
